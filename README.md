# daily-bugle-react 

This is my first completed website written in React and is for the fictional newspaper company shown in Marvel Comics - The Daily Bugle. All of its content is written from the point of view of the Editor in Cheif of the Daily Bugle, J. Jonah Jameson.

This site was deployed with the use of Netlify, and can be viewed [here](https://daily-bugle-react-app.netlify.app/).
